Click the gear icon (or the down arrow next to the "Run" button) and select "Create a launch.json file". This file configures your debugging environment.
Configure Launch.json (Basic Example):

The launch.json file opens in the editor. For a simple program, a basic configuration might look like this (assuming Node.js):
JSON
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Launch Current File",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}"
        }
    ]
}
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This configuration tells VS Code to launch your program (${file}) using the Node.js debugger (type": "node").
Set Breakpoints:

Click on the line of code where you want to pause execution during debugging. A red dot appears next to the line, indicating a breakpoint.
Start Debugging:

Click the green play button (or use the keyboard shortcut F5) in the Run and Debug view. VS Code launches your program and pauses at the first breakpoint.
Debugging Features:

Step Through Code:
Use the Step Over (F10) button to execute the current line and move to the next line.
Use the Step Into (F11) button to step into function calls, pausing at the first line of the called function.
Inspect Variables:
The Variables pane (usually on the left sidebar) displays the values of variables in your code at the current breakpoint. You can inspect their contents and modify them if needed.
Console:
The Integrated Terminal within VS Code can be used to view console output from your program during debugging.
Call Stack:
The Call Stack pane shows the sequence of function calls that led to the current breakpoint, helping you understand the program's execution flow.
**Using Source Control:**
Git Installed: Ensure you have Git installed on your system. You can download it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
